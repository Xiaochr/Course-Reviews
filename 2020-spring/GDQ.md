# 对策、决策与排队论

## Game theory

- Key elements of a game
    - Players
    - Strategies
    - Payoffs
    - Information
    - Rationality

- Representation of the games
    - The normal form
    - The extensive form
        - Information set

- Information
    - Perfect vs Imperfect
    - Complete vs Incomplete

- A strategy of a player is a complete contingent plan. 

- Mixed strategy

- Dominance
    - A rational player never plays a strictly dominated strategy. 
    - Weakly dominate

- Rationality + dominant strategies = Nash Equilibrium

- Ex. **Second-price auction**

- Rationalizability
    - traveler's dilemma
    - 如果你选的这个策略，在给定你对对方策略的belief（也就是对方在你选定这个策略情况下的最优选择）情况下，是optimal的，则成为rationalizable. 

- Nash Equilibirum
    - Best response

- Ex. **Cournot oligopoly**
    - $q_i^* = \frac{1-c}{n+1}$

- Ex. Information cascade
    - Even when individuals are rational, groups may not. 

- Never best response
    - It is not optimal against any belief about other players' action. 
    - A **strictly dominated** strategy is a never-best response. 
    - Eliminate them!

- Ex. First price auction

- Ex. Bertrand duopoly

- Ex. Problem of the commons
    - Social optimal number is less than the individual optimal number. 

- Ex. Bertrand competition with costly search

- Dynamic games of perfect information

- Sequential rationality
    - Backward induction. Always yields a NE. 

- Ex. Stackelberg duopoly competition
    - Leader, follower

- Ex. **Bargaining**

- Subgame perfect NE (SPE)

- Infinite period
    - Single-deviation principle

- Finite repeated games
    - Bayesian game

- Ex. Cournot duopoly with **incomplete info**

- Ex. Double auction

- Dynamic games with incomplete information
    - Requirements: 
        - beliefs 
        - sequential rationality 
        - consistency on the path 
        - consistency off the path

- **Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium**

- Agency theory
    - Hidden action model
    - Hidden information model

- Ex. Beer quiche game

## Decision theory

- Decision tree

- Value of information
    - Perfect/Imperfect

- Risk profile
    - Stochastic dominance

- Utility theory

- Maxmin expected utility

- Prospect theory

- Framing effects

- Probability assessment

## Queueing theory

因为只允许纸质 cheatsheet，所以排队部分的公式就不写在这里了。
